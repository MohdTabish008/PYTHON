#PYTHON

This is the starting period of backend development in which Python is used and framework in Django.As a starting move forward I have made a simple Guess the Code project in python to revisit basics.In this game user enters the code which has to match the 3 digit code auto generated in computer through the use of random library.

As we know Object Oriented Programmming is a fundamental aspect in any sort of development.So, I have made a Card War Game to put my knowledge of OOPs in Python into application.
The game takes user name as input and a game starts b/w user and computer & game is completed automatically.At the end it the displays the result & stats.This game has exhaustive knowledge and application of object oriented programming required for Backend Development.
